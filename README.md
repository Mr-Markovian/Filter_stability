Repo containing codes for experiments performed on Lorenz-96 chaotic system for dimensions 10 and 40. The experiments only use ensemble Kalman filter to compute the forecast and analysis ensemble. The assimilated experiments data are not uploaded. The final results of distance calculation is present.
